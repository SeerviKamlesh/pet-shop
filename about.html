                            Barkly and Meows is a locally owned and operated pet food and supply store. Our mission is
                            to
                            provide
                            dog and cat parents with everything that they need to ensure their pet lives a long and
                            happy
                            life.
                            We love to talk about pets of all types and we are even more excited when you bring your
                            furry
                            family member into the store to meet us! We are constantly researching and learning about
                            new
                            products that can make our pets lives better.

                            Our goal is to provide a clean, pet friendly store that has everything that your dog or cat
                            needs.
                            While our store is not very large, we offer an experience that is fast, friendly, local, and
                            less
                            expensive that the "Big Box" pet stores.
